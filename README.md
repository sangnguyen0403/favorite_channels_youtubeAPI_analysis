# 1. Project Description
YouTube is one of the most popular platforms nowadays with more than 2 billion users who watch YouTube regularly. According to YouTube statistics, people view more than one billion hours of video every day [1]. In addition, YouTube has recently become a valuable educational and learning resource for learners, thanks to its enormous variety of tutorials, courses, documentaries, and instructional videos. It offers learners an accessible platform for acquiring information and skills in various domains. As an inquisitive learner, I am interested in gaining new knowledge about data through YouTube videos besides what I have learned at university. Not only that, I can have valuable insight about data-related careers from seniors who already have experience in their careers. To apply what I've learned so far into practice, I've created a personal project that will analyze some of my favorite data-related channels to gain insights into their performances and factors that can affect their performance using data collected via the Youtube API.
